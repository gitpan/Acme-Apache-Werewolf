NAME
    Acme::Apache::Werewolf

SYNOPSIS
        <Directory /fullmoon>
            PerlAccessHandler Acme::Apache::Werewolf
            PerlSetVar MoonLength 4
        </Directory>

DESCRIPTION
    This mod_perl handler performs the important function of keeping
    werewolves out of a directory during the full moon.

        Better stay away from him
        He'll rip your lungs out, Jim

USAGE
    In your configuration file, put the following configuration

        <Directory /fullmoon>
            PerlAccessHandler Acme::Apache::Werewolf
            PerlSetVar MoonLength 4
        </directory>

    The MoonLength variable indicates how long a period you want to consider
    to be the full moon. In the above configuration, the full moon is 4
    days, which would be from day 12 through day 16 of the lunar cycle. It
    is wise to err on the side of caution and make this too large, rather
    than make it too small, and risk the wrath of werewolves.
